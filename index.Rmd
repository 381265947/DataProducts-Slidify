## Do you ever need to average lists of numbers?

1. _Yes!_
2. No

*** .hint
HINT: Everyone needs to average lists of numbers. All the time.

*** .explanation
People are always tossing around lists of numbers. What else would we do with them?

Hello. Let's talk about lists of numbers. Sometimes you have a list of numbers and you are desperate to average them. Well I've got a way for you to do that - along with visualizing the numbers. Does that sound like a great tool to have?

Well, enjoy: https://courseradude.shinyapps.io/project/

# Here's the code

Notice that spaces are handled properly because we live in the future.

```{r}
text <- "1, 2, 3, 4";
nums <- sapply(strsplit(text, "\\s*,\\s*"), as.numeric);
avg <- mean(nums);
avg;
```

---  

# Here's the visualization

```{r}
plot(nums);
abline(h = avg);
```
